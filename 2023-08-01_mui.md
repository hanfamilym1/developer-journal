## Type of Learning: Learning

### What I've Learned:

Learned about MUI's spacing and theming.

```

<Box
    sx: {{
        py: 2
    }}
    />
```

Essentially, in the code snippet above, I was trying to figure out what py stood for and the measurements of the number above.

The default spacing is set to 8px and so you can createTheme and include a baseTheme to change a spacing property.

Would look something like:

```
const baseTheme = {
    spacing: 12
}

createTheme(baseTheme)
```

Changing the default spacing to 12px.

So the py would look like 2\*12 = 24px
