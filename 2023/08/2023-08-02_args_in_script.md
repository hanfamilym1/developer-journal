## Type of Learning: Learning

### What I've Learned:

In index.js, I learned that you can just add process.argv and list off what specific item you are looking for to help add it in.

So when I run

```
npm run generate
```

I can just include the file name that I want in it and it will take that in and I can utilize that information

```
npm run generate args_in_script
const filePath = path.join(folderPath, `${formattedDate}_${fileName}.md`);

```

That's pretty rad.
