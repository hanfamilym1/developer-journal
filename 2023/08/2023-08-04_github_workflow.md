# Learning Entry - 2023-08-04

## Type of Learning: Tool

### What I've Learned:

Github has workflows that allow us to utilize different aspects of the repository. In this case, I created two workflows that go hand in hand with this project.

1. auto_comment.yml: where it will auto comment the changes that have happened and will link the url of the actual codespace. So in this instance it will comment this file in 2023/08/2023-08-04_github_workflow.md and so I'll be able to click on that and see the md file.

2. update_badge.yml: there's something called shield where it can create different badges. I wanted it so that the main README has all of the different labels and the different PR's attached to it. After something is merged, it will redo the README to include the numbers received.

I also needed to create different secret variables in the repository so that all of this would work.
